Hi, there
Thanks for your giving chance to apply for this job.
And Now, I am going to tell about sports that I like to play at free time.
Every day, I often used to play running for approximately 30 mins at morning.
This makes me more active and strong so that I can spend my work time as software developer upon seamless condition.
At the day when I play running at the morning, I am more likely to conduct so much efficient and fruitable work.
And then, I am willing to talk about badminton.
At my spare time, I often like playing badminton together with my collegues.
As you see, badminton is a fast racket sport that needs more speed and flexiblitiy as well as decision-making ability.
So, If we developers often play this, this can help us achieve unexpectable result in development by enhancing our abiltity.
Next, I can take football for my favourite sport item.
Football is well-known as the most popular sport among people worldwidly.
Football requires firm and strong team collaboration to win the game, that's why I like more it and recommend others to play it more often.
To conclude, I appreciate you giving the best chance for my professional growth.
Thank you.
